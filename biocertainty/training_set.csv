Here we show that phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase also acts downstream of the TGF-Î² receptor complex to induce the activation of Erk, through Pak2 phosphorylation of c-Raf at S338, a known site of Pak activation , , .
Previous work has shown that Gab1 is not a global substrate of Shp2, as complex formation between Gab1 and Shp2 does not reduce the total EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Gab1 [ ].
More work is required to confirm these data and to determine the exact mechanism by which SHP2 suppresses cellular senescence in glioblastoma, but it is clear that it plays an important role in the viability of these cells.
Basement membrane is a thin extracellular matrix that underlies epithelia and endothelia and separates epithelial cancer cells from the stroma.
Interpretations of interaction studies in yeast inferred that tail domain subunits of the Gal11 submodule (e.g. MED16) contact the C-terminal part of MED14, while regions of MED14 further N-terminal interact with MED9 and MED10 submodules, which form part of the body domain ( , ).
We estimate that approximately 5% of total cellular RhoA is localized to the nucleus of HEK cells at steady state.
